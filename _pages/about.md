I am Magi Chen, a Ph.D. in Computer Science at National Tsing Hua University, specializing in AI for Electronic Design Automation (AI4EDA) and deep learning research. With over 21 years of industry experience, I bring a unique perspective that bridges the gap between academic research and practical industrial applications.

Currently, I am the founder of **GradInnovate**, where I focus on developing innovative AI solutions for the semiconductor and VLSI design industry. My research interests include machine learning for circuit design, GPU-accelerated algorithms, and generative models for electronic design automation.

## Research Focus

My work spans several key areas in AI and computer engineering:

- **AI for Electronic Design Automation (AI4EDA)**: Developing machine learning models for circuit design optimization
- **Hypergraph Partitioning**: Creating novel generative models for efficient VLSI design
- **GPU-Accelerated Computing**: Optimizing algorithms for high-performance computing applications
- **Deep Learning**: Applying neural networks to solve complex engineering problems

## Professional Journey

After spending over two decades in the industry, I took an unpaid leave to pursue my Ph.D. and explore the intersection of artificial intelligence and electronic design. This transition has allowed me to combine my extensive practical experience with cutting-edge research, resulting in several publications at top-tier conferences like ICCAD and DAC.

I am passionate about bridging the gap between academia and industry, translating research insights into practical solutions that can benefit the broader engineering community.
