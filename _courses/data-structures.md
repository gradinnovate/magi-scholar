## Course Overview

A comprehensive study of fundamental data structures and algorithms essential for efficient programming. This course covers the design, implementation, and analysis of data structures including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

## Topics Covered

### Data Structures
- Arrays and Dynamic Arrays
- Linked Lists (Single, Double, Circular)
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees (Binary, BST, AVL, Red-Black)
- Hash Tables
- Graphs

### Algorithms
- Searching and Sorting
- Tree Traversals
- Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Shortest Path)
- Dynamic Programming
- Algorithm Analysis (Big O Notation)

## Programming Language

All assignments will be completed in **Java**. Students should be familiar with object-oriented programming concepts.

## Assessment

| Component | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Programming Assignments | 50% |
| Midterm Exams (2) | 30% |
